# Scheduling-Algorithm
## Scheduling Algorithm Simulation using Multithreading

#### Download the Project Instruction file if you are interested in what requirements are asked to build this project.

#### Run the code in Terminal with the following command lines:
* First compile with this line: `javac finalProject.java`
* Then run the code with one argument, which is the full path of the input csv file: `java finalProject.java Example1.csv`

#### After running the code, you should get something like this:
